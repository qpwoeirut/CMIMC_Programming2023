strategy:

1) keep track of an estimate of the number of lives we have left, as well as a running counter of the number of games played
2) play a very small number on the first game (losing a life in the beginning is ok if we get a strategic advantage from it
3) if a player has one life left, then depending on our estimate of our current lives, we can choose to spare them (since they will likely die later anyway)
4) we need to deduce a range estimate for the guess, and then determine whether it is wise to challenge the opponent
5) if we reach a stage in the game/come across an opponent who we think is likely to make a larger bet, we should bet small if we have many lives left
6) once we have one life left we should challenge everything
7) if we can take a life off of someone who has many lives left we should
8) we can split the game into 3 stages
    a) in the early game, we should try to conserve both currency and lives
        i) we should aim to lose at most 2 lives in the first 5 games
        ii) we can determine whether a player is likely to play conservatively using the metrics given
    b) midgame is about attacking people
        i) we should aim to conserve 15-20 currency for the endgame, meaning that we can place decently large bets in midgame
        ii) we should try to take out as many players with many lives as possible
        iii) we need to be very careful about losing lives if we suspect the early game has not gone well
            ->) if it has gone well, then we should not challenge people with <= 2 lives left
            ->) if not, then we may have to challenge everything
                =>) we can try to implement something random for this case
    c) endgame is about conservation
        i) every team that makes it to the endgame likely does not have much currency left, and has also bet conservatively (in order to not run out of currency)
        ii) bets will likely be small unless a player is on their last life, in which case they are inclined to bet what they have
        iii) just focus on survival in this portion; if an opponent has one life left, then choose to challenge/not challenge
            ->) in the case that a challenge is made, you can go all in
                =>) perhaps choose small bets randomly
9) we can increase the threshold for betting once we get to a point where we have very few lives left
    a) with one life left we should bet at least half of what we have each time
